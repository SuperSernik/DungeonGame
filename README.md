# Dark Dungeon
This is my first big project which I designed from the bottom up. I began working on this project in October 2021 and most of the work was done within a span of a year, however I would come back now and then to tweak some things or add new functionality to the game such as the zoom feature ( which is more of a gimmick than anything, I just wanted to test the application of transform matrices in my camera class).
When I first began designing the back end for the game, I went for a singleton class approach, however now looking back I would go for a more traditional OOP layout. Overall, I never really got to ‘finish’ the game as when it came time to start implementing functionality, I quickly realised that my ‘backend priority’ approach made it increasingly difficult for me to implement things such as pathfinding for NPCs.
However, despite all the floors in this game (mainly regarding game mechanics) I learned a lot about how to structure a bigger piece of code. I originally tried to design the code to allow for expandability later down the line, however this never came to fruition.
